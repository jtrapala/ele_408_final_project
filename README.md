# ELE 408 Final Project
Project: Embedded Lock System

This system will be composed of the following items: a deadbolt, plywood housing for deadbolt, TowerPro M995R motor, a DE1-Soc FPGA board, and a web application. 

Our plan is to enter a pin (4 digit) on a keypad displayed on the touchscreen of the FPGA and be then able to unlock the deadbolt with the assistance of the motor. 

The web application will be able to keep track of assigned pins and entries as well as report when an incorrect pin has been entered. The entries made with a correct pin and invalid events are recorded with a timestamp.
